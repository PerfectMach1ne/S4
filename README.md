# S4

Simple Screenshot Storage Service. Need anymore context? Python. That's all you get. Oh, you want more? **TOO BAD.**

## Milestones/feature ToDo list

- [ ] Figure out a CI/CD pipeline (SSH into TransEdenV3, push-n-pull code and run it).
- [ ] Write a CLI interface for the HTTP server.
- [ ] Display screenshot data in the right order.
- [ ] Validate screenshot data (feature/function).
- [ ] MD5 check screenshots (feature/function).
- [ ] Compress, send, receive and transform screenshots into the proper format from TransEdenV4 to TransEdenV3 ~~baby's first ETL~~.
